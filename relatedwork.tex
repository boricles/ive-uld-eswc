There are available works such as (1) \emph{LODStats}\footnote{\footnotesize \url{http://stats.lod2.eu/}} that provides the information related to a dataset, and (2) \emph{make-void} \footnote{\footnotesize \url{https://github.com/cygri/make-void}} that computes statistics about RDF files. However, LODStats is thought for the whole set of LOD datasets registered in The Data Hub \footnote{\footnotesize \url{http://thedatahub.com}}, and it is based on declarative descriptions of those datasets; and \emph{make-void} is thought for RDF files but not for RDF datasets.
