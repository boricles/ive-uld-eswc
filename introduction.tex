So far, Linked Data principles and practices are being adopted by an increasing number of data providers, getting as result a global data space on the Web containing hundreds of LOD datasets \cite{Heath_Bizer_2011}. In this context it is important to promote the reuse and linkage of datasets, and to this end, it is necessary to know the structure of datasets. One step forward for knowing in depth the structure of a given dataset is to provide a summary of the dataset.

There are available works such as (1) \emph{LODStats}\footnote{\footnotesize \url{http://stats.lod2.eu/}} that provides the information related to a dataset, and (2) \emph{make-void} \footnote{\footnotesize \url{https://github.com/cygri/make-void}} that computes statistics about RDF files. However, LODStats is thought for the whole set of LOD datasets registered in The Data Hub \footnote{\footnotesize \url{http://thedatahub.com}}, and it is based on declarative descriptions of those datasets; and \emph{make-void} is thought for RDF files but not for RDF datasets.

In this paper we present fancy-name\footnote{\footnotesize \url{http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/honghan.wu/pages/summ/}}, a simple tool to help users get a quick understanding of RDF dataset ...
