So far, Linked Data principles and practices are being adopted by an increasing number of data providers, getting as result a global data space on the Web containing hundreds of LOD datasets~\cite{bizer2009linked}. However the technical prerequisites of using Semantic Web dataset prevent efficient exploitations on these datasets. To tackle this problem, in this paper we present a summarisation based approach which can not only provide a quick understanding of the dataset in question, but also is able to guide users in exploiting it in various ways.

In this demo, we will introduce our graph pattern based exploitation system\footnote{http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/honghan.wu/pages/kd.wp3/} and demonstrate three exploitation tasks of \emph{(Quick Understanding)} big picture presenting and summary browsing, \emph{(Guided Exploitation)} two query generation methods, and \emph{(Dataset Enrichment)} atomic pattern based dataset linkage. This work is supported by K-Drive project\footnote{ EU FP7 IAPP / Grant agreement no.: 286348}.

The rest of paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we briefly discuss the related work. Then, in section 3 we  introduce the details of the summarisation definition and generation. In section 4, we demonstrate several typical data exploitation scenarios based on the information and properties of our summarisation. Conclusions and future work are briefly given in the final section.
