So far, Linked Data principles and practices are being adopted by an increasing number of data providers, getting as result a global data space on the Web containing hundreds of LOD datasets \cite{Heath_Bizer_2011}. In this context it is important to promote the reuse and linkage of datasets.

To increase the reuse of datasets is necessary to provide a very good snapshot of datasets. This snapshot must include the description of the dataset along with the important facts of it. Basically, this set of important facts of the dataset is know as the summary of the dataset. In this paper we present an approach for summarizing Linked Data datasets based on a pattern extraction algorithm.

The rest of paper is organized as follows: firstly, we introduce the details of the summarisation definition and generation. Then, we present the good properties of this summarisation and propose a set of useful services from the summarisation, both of which can be utilised to guide data exploitation tasks like query writing, ontology reasoning, data compression, and data diagnosis. Finally, we evaluate our approach in several typical data exploitation scenarios. Experiments on real word datasets show that our approach can guide very efficient data exploitation.
